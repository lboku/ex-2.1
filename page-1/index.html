        If I had been open with you from 
        the start… and looked you straight 
        in the eyes and told you the truth, 
        then I wouldn't have had to stand 
        before you, from above, as a failure, 
        telling you all of this. So this time, 
        I want to impart this truth to you… You 
        don't even have to forgive me. And no 
        matter what you do from here on out, 
        know this… I will love you always."

        The user can perform what is generically 
        called Genjutsu: Sharingan. While there 
        are various manifestations and purposes 
        of the ability, the better known one is 
        to, through eye contact, suggest thoughts
        and actions to a target, coercing them to 
        divulge information or act in a particular
        way, potentially without the target's 
        awareness.

   <p>The Sharingan can be evolved into the Mangekyō 
    Sharingan by experiencing the trauma of loss, 
    granting unique, user-specific jutsu in addition
    to the Sharingan's standard abilities. Awakening
    the Mangekyō Sharingan will automatically fully
    mature a Sharingan if it isn't already.

    <p>The Rinnegan (輪廻眼, literally meaning: Saṃsāra
        Eye) is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst
        the "Three Great Dōjutsu",[3] the others being
        the Sharingan and the Byakugan. It is said
        that in times of disorder, one who wields
        the Rinnegan is sent down from the heavens
        to become either a "God of Creation" who 
        will calm the world or a "God of Destruction"
        who will reduce everything to nothingness. 
        The Rinnegan is characterised by concentric 
        circles covering the eyeball
