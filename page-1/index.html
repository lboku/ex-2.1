    <p>
        If I had been open with you from 
        the start… and looked you straight 
        in the eyes and told you the truth, 
        then I wouldn't have had to stand 
        before you, from above, as a failure, 
        telling you all of this. So this time, 
        I want to impart this truth to you… You 
        don't even have to forgive me. And no 
        matter what you do from here on out, 
        know this… I will love you always."
