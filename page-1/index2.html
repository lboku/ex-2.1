    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
A Mangekyō Sharingan is distinguished 
from a normal Sharingan by its appearance, 
which changes the form of the tomoe seal. 
While the exact design differs for each user,
they all resemble pinwheels. It is initially 
awakened by the trauma suffered from witnessing 
the death of someone close to the user. Uchiha 
have historically misunderstood this criteria 
as the user needing to be responsible for the 
person's death, and for that reason they developed 
the practice of killing their closest friends in 
order to gain the Mangekyō Sharingan. Obito's 
Mangekyō activated immediately after his trauma, 
whereas, in Naruto Jinraiden, Sasuke's Mangekyō 
didn't activate until several weeks afterwards.

        The Mangekyō Sharingan retains all of the Sharingan's 
        generic abilities. In addition to that, the
        Mangekyō grants powerful abilities that differ 
        between each eye, though abilities may be similar 
        in nature; both Sasuke and Itachi have access to 
        Amaterasu's flames, though the extent to which they 
        can use them differ. The abilities of a Mangekyō 
        Sharingan may not even be the same for both of a 
        single user's eyes, as Itachi has Amaterasu in one 
        eye and Tsukuyomi in another. As each eye houses 
        the particular dōjutsu techniques, one can only 
        access them if they currently house the said eye, 
        even if they were the originator of the said technique. 
        Once a user awakens the Mangekyō in both eyes, they 
        are able to perform Susanoo, even without either eye. 
        In addition to the unique techniques, the straight tomoe 
        (直巴, choku tomoe) of Madara's and Sasuke's Mangekyō 
        Sharingan grants them greater fluidity in their
        movements when fighting. Madara was able to sense 
        this form and later deduced that he and Sasuke must 
        be connected by more than blood.
