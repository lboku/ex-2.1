        <h1>Acquisition</h1>
        <p>
The first person on Earth to wield 
the Rinnegan was Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki,
whose mother possessed the Rinne 
Sharingan. In the anime, he obtained 
his Rinnegan at the same time as his 
Mangekyō Sharingan, which awakened as 
a result of mortally wounding his brother.
 Using the power of the Rinnegan, Hagoromo 
saved the world from the Ten-Tails and created
ninshū, the precursor to modern ninjutsu. For
his contributions to the world, Hagoromo became 
revered as the Sage of Six Paths, and both he 
and his eyes rose to mythological status following 
his death; even when the Rinnegan was later proven 
to exist, some dismissed it as a random mutation.

    It is possible for a Sharingan wielder 
    to awaken a new Rinnegan by obtaining 
    Hagoromo's chakra, either by combining 
    the chakra of his sons, Indra and Asura, 
    to recreate his own, or by directly 
    receiving it from Hagoromo himself.
    Black Zetsu spent centuries attempting 
    to manipulate the reincarnations of Indra
     and Asura into awakening the Rinnegan, 
     but it was not until the time of Madara 
     Uchiha — Indra's reincarnate — that this 
     was successful. Madara implanted the 
     flesh of Hashirama Senju — Asura's 
     reincarnate — into his own body, causing 
     a part of Asura's chakra to combine with 
     Indra's. However, Madara's eyes did not
      become Rinnegan until decades later, when
      his natural lifespan was nearing its end;
      this also restored his right eye's 
      vision, which had been lost from his earlier use 
      of Izanagi. Orochimaru and Kabuto Yakushi 
      later hypothesised that the Sharingan can be 
      evolved into the Rinnegan by combining Uchiha 
      and Senju DNA. To that end, Kabuto successfully 
      recreated the Rinnegan by infusing Hashirama's 
      cells into Madara's reincarnated body, though 
      these fake eyes did not have full access to the 
      original's abilities.
