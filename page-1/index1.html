    <h1>Acquisition</h1>
<p>
When a wielder of this kekkei genkai
experiences a powerful emotional 
condition with regards to a person 
precious to them, their brain releases 
a special form of chakra that affects 
the optic nerves, transforming the eyes
into Sharingan; for that reason the 
Sharingan is described as an "eye that
reflects the heart" (心を写す瞳, Kokoro
o utsusu hitomi). Often, as per 
the Uchiha's so-called "Curse of Hatred",
this emotion is a negative one, brought 
on by stress or loss. The emotion 
can also be positive, driven by a desire 
to protect or reunite with a loved one.

In the anime, it was shown that usually 
after first acquiring this power, the
user's enhanced perception will throw 
off their timing, causing them to overstress 
their bodies from trying to keep up with 
the increased reaction time, forcing the 
user to adjust to properly move with it. 
A higher control of one's chakra is also 
required to maintain its power for long. 
It was also shown during emotional states 
that begin to trigger the Sharingan's 
awakening, it can temporarily blur the 
person's eyesight until finally manifesting.
Assuming that the user is aware they 
have awakened the Sharingan, they are 
thereafter able to freely use it. When 
first awakened, each Sharingan usually will 
have only one tomoe (巴), although in some 
case, they immediately gained two tomoe in 
each of their eyes. Through emotional growth
of extreme conditions, the Sharingan will 
continue to develop, its full maturation 
represented by a third tomoe. When Hagoromo
awakened the Sharingan in the anime, he 
had all three tomoe immediately. All the 
Sharingan's abilities are available to the
user from its earliest stage, but with 
greater development comes greater proficiency 
with those abilities. Example, with full maturation, 
the Sharingan's ability to perceive all targets and 
events around them is fully developed, which can 
cause the user's movements to drastically differ 
from their earlier movements if their Sharingan 
matured mid-battle.
