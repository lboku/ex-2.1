<p>
When a wielder of this kekkei genkai
experiences a powerful emotional 
condition with regards to a person 
precious to them, their brain releases 
a special form of chakra that affects 
the optic nerves, transforming the eyes
into Sharingan; for that reason the 
Sharingan is described as an "eye that
reflects the heart" (心を写す瞳, Kokoro
o utsusu hitomi). Often, as per 
the Uchiha's so-called "Curse of Hatred",
this emotion is a negative one, brought 
on by stress or loss. The emotion 
can also be positive, driven by a desire 
to protect or reunite with a loved one.
